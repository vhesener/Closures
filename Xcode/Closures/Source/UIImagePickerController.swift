     This is a convenience initializer that allows you to setup your
     UIImagePickerController with some commonly used default settings.
     In addition, it provides a default handler for a cancelled picker,
     but you are free to provide your own `didCancel` implementation
     using the `didCancel` parameter. The only required parameter is
     the `didPick` closure, which will be called when the user picks
     a medium.
     
     * important: The picker will not be attempted to be dismissed
     after this closure is called, unless you use the
     `present(from:animation:)` method.
     
     * * * *
     #### An example of initializing with this method:
     ```swift
     let picker = UIImagePickerController(
         source: .camera,
         allow: [.image, .movie]) { [weak self] result,picker in
             myImageView.image = result.originalImage
             self?.dismiss(animated: animation.animate)
         }
     }
     ```
     
     * parameter source: The `UIImagePickerControllerSourceType` that
     UIImagePickerController expects to determine where the content
     should be obtained from. This value will be applied to the
     picker's `sourceType` property.
     * parameter allow: A convenience `OptionSet` filter based on `kUTType` Strings.
     These types will be applied to the picker's mediaTypes property.
     * parameter cameraOverlay: This is equivalent to `UIImagePickerController`'s
     `cameraOverlayView` property and will be applied as such.
     * parameter showsCameraControls: This is equivalent to `UIImagePickerController`'s
     `showsCameraControls` property and will be applied as such.
     * parameter didCancel: The closure that is called when the `didCancel` delegate
     method is called. The default is to attempt to dismiss the picker.
     * parameter didPick: The closure that is called when the
     imagePickerController(_:didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:) is called.
     The closure conveniently wraps the Dictionary obtained from this
     delegate call in a `Result` struct. The original Dictionary can
     be found in the `rawInfo` property.

     picker. This view controller is also used to dismiss the picker for the default
     dismissing behavior.
     * parameter animation: An animation info tuple that describes whether to
     animate the presenting and what to do after the animation is complete.
